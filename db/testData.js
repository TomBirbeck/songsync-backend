        `Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans,
        Way back up in the woods among the evergreens,
        There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood,
        Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode,
        Who never ever learned to read or write so well,
        But he could play the guitar just a-ringin' a bell`

        Kicking your can all over the place singin'`

        I trade my soul for a wish,
        Pennies and dimes for a kiss`
